Description: Tail a bunch of files and forward them to syslog
 This program has been developped to replace rsyslog v5's imfile which was not
 handling logfile truncature (which is a common rotation mode for application
 logs which do not handle logfile reopening), was way to verbose to configure
 and needed to be reconfigured and restarted every time a logfile was added,
 removed or renamed.
