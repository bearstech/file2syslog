# Various logfiles generated by apps (and not by syslogd), which will be
# tailed and forwarded to syslog. Wildcards (POSIX globs) are allowed and
# missing logfiles are ignored.

# You may append a 'tag' (the syslog ident value) which will replace the
# filename while relayed to syslog

# Note that wildcards are only evaluated at startup time. If a file satisfying
# a glob appears after file2syslog has started, it will not be detected.
#
#/var/log/apache2/*.log apache

# Otherwise with plain filenames the file is automatically tracked when it
# appears and untracked when it is removed, no matter when.

#/var/log/redis/redis-server.log redis
